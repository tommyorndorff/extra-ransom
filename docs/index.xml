      <description>Tom Morgan Bamboo Build Class # These are the notes from the class. They were given out on sheets of paper. I&amp;rsquo;ve re-written them here and amended them where I needed additional notes.
Split Culms # Choose culms. Bottom of the culms are used for the butts. Top of the culms are used for tips Nodes are spaced closer together at the bottom. They&amp;rsquo;re wider at the top The goal is for more power fibers at the bottom of the rod blank Cut culms to 5-6&amp;rsquo; sections: one for bottom &amp;amp; one for top Inspect for depth of power fibers Split into strip with star splitter, mallet &amp;amp; pipe.</description>

Unlocking the Mysteries of the Garrison Binder # by Chris Bogart
Hiding this ramble. Did you ever wonder why (to quote Andy Rooney) the Garrison binder is for many rodmakers the source of contentious problems while other rodmakers never seem to have problems.

      <description>Notes on Rod Binders # Because my brain isn&amp;rsquo;t the lint catch that it used to be, here are some notes for reference. Preference toward Internet Archive and ensuring they&amp;rsquo;re cataloged in the Wayback Machine.
Smithwick Rod Binder # From Canerod.com, there&amp;rsquo;s a PDF referenced.
Fantastic Gallery of Binders on bamboorodmaking.com # Wayback Machine
Pulleys for Belt Drive # I have a couple of questions regarding building a binder. I&amp;rsquo;ve located some pulleys at the hardware store with ~ 1/4&amp;quot; channel in them, is this too wide or doesn&amp;rsquo;t it matter?</description>
