      <description>Tom Morgan Bamboo Build Class # These are the notes from the class. They were given out on sheets of paper. I&amp;rsquo;ve re-written them here and amended them where I needed additional notes.
Split Culms # Choose culms. Bottom of the culms are used for the butts. Top of the culms are used for tips Nodes are spaced closer together at the bottom. They&amp;rsquo;re wider at the top The goal is for more power fibers at the bottom of the rod blank Cut culms to 5-6&amp;rsquo; sections: one for bottom &amp;amp; one for top Inspect for depth of power fibers Split into strip with star splitter, mallet &amp;amp; pipe.</description>

      <description>Notes on Rod Binders # Because my brain isn&amp;rsquo;t the lint catch that it used to be, here are some notes for reference. Preference toward Internet Archive and ensuring they&amp;rsquo;re cataloged in the Wayback Machine.
Smithwick Rod Binder # From Canerod.com, there&amp;rsquo;s a PDF referenced.
Fantastic Gallery of Binders on bamboorodmaking.com # Wayback Machine
Pulleys for Belt Drive # I have a couple of questions regarding building a binder. I&amp;rsquo;ve located some pulleys at the hardware store with ~ 1/4&amp;quot; channel in them, is this too wide or doesn&amp;rsquo;t it matter?</description>
