## Pulleys for Belt Drive

I have a couple of questions regarding building a binder. I've located some pulleys at the hardware store with ~ 1/4" channel in them, is this too wide or doesn't it matter? What should I use for a belt?  (Mark Pohl)

You can use either a round leather, or round urethane drive belt. The 1/4" wide groove shouldn't be a problem, and you can get the belting in 1/4", too.  (Martin-Darrell)

I used something similar, rollers from a patio door - got them at Lowes, brass with bushings about 1/4 inch groove.   I built my binder ALA Garrison design, but have modified it per a suggestion on the list.  Make a second main drive pulley and stack them together.  Wind one pulley full of 50# braided nylon  masons twine - I anchored the twine by drilling a small hole for a screw, sticking the end of the drive belt/string in the hole and screwing the screw in.  Do the same think with the end of the belt on the empty drive pulley.  Crank the pulleys backwards to rewind all of the belt onto the other pulley.  Thread the belt through your pulleys and around a 1/4 test dowel, hang your weight on the belt and away you go.  The benefit is NO slipping of the belt, and NO bump as the splice or knot in the belt traverses the rod.  I use Polyurethane glue and run the belt back and forth through a cloth dampened with paint thinner after glue up.  Use the appropriate solvent for your glue for cleanup.  (Kurt Clement)
