# Bamboo Ferrules
Taking notes on _how_ bamboo ferrules are made before I ruin a first attempt.

There's an Italian made named Alberto Poratelli that wrote a doc on what he calls _streamlined ferrules_  ([link](http://www.aprods.it/innesto/BF_eng.pdf) & [cached link](/static/bamboo-ferrules/poratelli_BF_eng.pdf)).

Streamlined ferrules are on a taper from Poratelli ([link](https://www.powerfibers.com/assets/files/7643S%20The%20Brook.pdf) & [cached link](/static/bamboo-ferrules/7643s_the_brook.pdf)).  The taper is in Power Fibers Issue 61 along with an interview.
