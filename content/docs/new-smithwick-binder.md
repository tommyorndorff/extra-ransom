# 'New' Smithwick Binder
My first attempt at a binder is this Smithwick.  Initial build was successful and I was able to bind bamboo.

Primarily used the Groth [binderplan PDF](/static/new-smithwick-rod-binder/Groth_Smithwick_binderplan.pdf) and should have used the photo as well.

## Improvements
* The arms need to be open at the top.  
* Move to all wood construction
