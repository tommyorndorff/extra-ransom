# Adhesives

## Ferrule Glue
It has been recommended to me to use 3Mâ€™s DP2216 adhesive. This is currently manufacturer part number [DP2216 41.5ML](https://www.extra-ransom.net/docs/equipment/adhesives/#:~:text=manufacturer%20part%20number-,DP2216%2041.5ML,-.%20Looks%20like%20it). Looks like it requires a ScotchWeld plunger, which I didnt order.
