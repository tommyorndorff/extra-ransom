it's been a while since i committed to doing this. 684 days or there abouts.

when i first had a sponsor, the first task for me to complete was, "write down all the things that you cannot change."  i didnt do that, putting it off with the excuse of 'focusing on being clean'. but that should change so here we are.

without ceremony, here is a list of things that i cannot change and sometimes including the caveat:
* the weather (although i can change where i am)
* politics (the immediate implementation/impacts of)
* where i've been in my past
* who i've been in my past
* what i've done to other people in my past
* the progress of time
* misophonia

there's a longer list of 'things that i havent been able to change' which i suspect are not in this task. here's a list:
* lose weight
* *ride my fuckig bike*
* gain back my flexibility
* settle down in one place for longer parts of the year so i can build up community
